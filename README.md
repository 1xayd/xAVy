xayd's Anti-Virus-y
Made in the span of 8~ days with one day break. Initially, i was making a jit addition to the lightlang but instead decided to make an antivirus for some reason.
It's pretty good at detecting threats. av_model.json was trained on 1200 bad binaries/1100 safe binaries.
Uses a simple model with leaky RELU, adam and some other basic shenanigans.
